What were you trying to do?
The goal was the build an application which would convert expressions into CDNF showing each step with justifications. 
The motivation for this is that equivalent expressions have the same CDNF, thefore one can prove that two expressions are equivalent by converting them to CDNF as checking that they're the same.

How did you go about it?  
I decided to build this application in C# mainly because of my familiarity with it and ease of GUI creation.
In terms of my process I broke the project down into subproblems: designing a GUI, parsing input, converting the input to NNF, converting from NNF to DNF, then finally from DNF to CDNF.

How did it work?
Great success!

What changes/extensions would you like to see? 
The ability to convert to CCNF would be a natural next step. Also, exporting to the .bram filetype.

What did you learn?
Proofs of this fashion can be deceptively long. Seemingly trivial equivalences can take many many steps to prove.
