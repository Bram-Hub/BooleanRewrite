# BooleanRewrite
Educational tool for converting propositional logic functions to canonical disjunctive normal form (CDNF), showing each step with the equvalence rule used. Can also be used to prove equivalence between two expressions by showing they have the same CDNF expression.

## How to use
![HowTo](https://i.imgur.com/y08O0oA.png)\
You can enter just one expression if you only want to see what its CDNF looks like, or two to test for equivalence. The final CDNF expression can be ordered such that the first row of the equvalent truth table is either all true or all false using a toggle under the File menu item. 

"Proofs" can be exported to .csv files showing conversions with steps in either the right to left direction or left to right direction using the Export feature also found uder the File menu item.

## Requirements
.NET Framework 4.5 or higher
